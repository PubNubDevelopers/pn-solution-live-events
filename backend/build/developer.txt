1. Build a Node JS server app that runs in a run-loop setInterval once every second. 
2. Trigger actions based on a timeline of events defined as an array of objects in milliseconds ms as timeSinceVideoStartedInMs found in exports.matchScript from our game-data.js file. The game-data.js file holds all the events and will be shared later.
3. Single server.js file that can be started with npm run.
4. Output only code as JavaScript in the server.js file.
5. The video needs to be synchronized via a periodic pubnub publish call to signal to the front-end app the timecode to seek to.
6. The events in the timeline need to correspond to simulated user activity triggering emoji reactions, and chat messages.
7. API Keys and config via ENV vars with `require("dotenv").config()`.
8. Use random bot users (bot-01 to bot-09).
9. Print all actions and events with `console.log()` including video timeline tick events, and user lead actions that trigger other events and when the video seek occurs.
10. Add random delay between each user's simulated reactions and chat.
11. Create a lot of simulated user chat messages! At least 50 different chat messages for each event type.
12. Restart the timeline back to 0 when the timeline ends. This repeats forever.
