1. Build a Node JS server app that runs in a run-loop setInterval once every second. 
2. Trigger actions based on a timeline of events defined as an array of objects in milliseconds ms as timeSinceVideoStartedInMs found in exports.matchScript from our game-data.js file. The game-data.js file holds all the events and will be shared later.
3. Chat mesages found in exports.chatMessagesForEvent from our chat-data.js file.
4. Single server.js file that can be started with npm run.
5. Output only code as JavaScript in the server.js file.
6. The video needs to be synchronized via a periodic pubnub publish call to signal to the front-end app the timecode to seek to.
7. The events in the timeline need to correspond to simulated user activity triggering emoji reactions, and chat messages.
8. API Keys and config via ENV vars with `require("dotenv").config()`.
9. Require PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY and PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY in the .env file
10. Print all actions and events with `console.log()` including video timeline tick events, and user actions that trigger other events and when the video seek occurs.
11. Add realistic random delay between each simulated reactions and chat.
12. Add extra activity for simulated reactions so it looks more exciting.
13. Restart the timeline back to 0 when the timeline ends. This repeats forever.
14. Start server on port 4000.
